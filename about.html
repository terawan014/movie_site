    <p class="introduction">Hi! My name is Tera, and I’m currently a student majoring in Compture Engineering. I’ve always been passionate about films, especially those that are narrative-driven, emotionally rich, or visually experimental.
      This website is my first personal project, created to document and share my thoughts on the films I’ve watched. More importantly, it’s also my way of learning how to build websites from scratch using just HTML and CSS. I started with no background in web development, so every page here is a step in my learning journey.</p>

      This site is built entirely with:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTML</strong> – for structuring the content</li>
    
    <li><strong>CSS</strong> – for styling and layout</li>
  </ul>
